						<p>
							The importance of environment representations for the operation of autonomous robots cannot
							be underestimated. Maps modeling geometrical aspects of environments, like grid maps and
							point clouds, are widely used in robotics. However, increasingly complex robot tasks and
							applications require increasingly richer representations such as semantic maps, which
							associate labels to portions of environments. Methods to build these maps are well covered
							by regular sessions at ICRA (e.g., SLAM and Semantic Scene Understanding sessions at ICRA
							2022).
						</p>
						<p>
							The goal of the workshop is to further advance in the direction of developing
							unconventional, possibly richer and informative, environment representations for autonomous
							robots, building on recent results and extending them beyond the boundaries of methods
							currently used in robotics.
						</p>
						<p>
							Specifically, the workshop will reflect the state of the art and stimulate innovation along
							the following dimensions
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The workshop will address both "problems" (what representation is needed for a given
								task) and "solutions" (what representations are available).</li>
							<li>The workshop will look beyond classical explicit representations like SLAM maps, to
								include machine learning models that provide implicit representations, like those
								embedded in end-to-end neural networks that, given perceptual inputs, return environment
								properties or robot actions.</li>
							<li>The workshop will also cover long-term representations that evolve over time to
								continuously adapt to the represented environments, for example, to model changing
								aspects or moving agents (both robots and humans).</li>
							<li>The workshop will discuss what technological solutions are needed to develop suitable
								unconventional representations, which includes a pipeline of methods for perception,
								data processing, model building, and model updating.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The main expected outcome of the workshop is the definition of the first version of a
							"toolbox" of possible environment representations from which practitioners can choose the
							most suitable ones for their specific applications according to specific requirements and
							constraints. The availability of this toolbox is expected to stimulate research not only to
							expand the toolbox but also in terms of benchmarking and standardization.</p>
